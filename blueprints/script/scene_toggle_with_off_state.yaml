blueprint:
  name: Scene Toggle with Off state
  description: >

    This script is based on the amazing work of panhans with his [Simple Scene Toggle](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/simple-scene-toggle) script.

    You can toggle your lights (and other devices) with this script on and off. For the on state, 
    scenes are used. With multiple executions (before the reset time) this script will rotate thorugh 
    your scenes in the given order. The last on scene will be remembered.

    ## Example

    Selected scenes: "ambiente", "medium", "bright"

    Sequence:

    - everything is off in the beginning

    - script executed -> scene "ambiente"

    - script executed again -> scene "medium"

    - a while later (longer than the reset time)

    - script executed -> turn everything off

    - a while later (longer than the reset time)

    - script executed -> scene "medium"
